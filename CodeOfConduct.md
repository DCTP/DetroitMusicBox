# Code of Conduct 

## Words we live by: 
Creative, open, justice, encouraging, accepting, inclusive, social

## How we work:
We follow the principles outlined by the Detroit Digital Justice Coalition. Please take a look at those broader guidelines before continuing on with this document.

We want to encourage encouragement! We strive to be open to sharing thoughts and ideas and giving constructive feedback on each other’s work. If you’re interested, feel free to reach out and network with others in our community through meetups online or off. We value relationship-building and mutual support networks. We can make others feel safe and supported by encouraging positive behavior and contributing to a culture of cooperation and community.

The community will not tolerate talking down to people, exclusivity, perpetuating stereotypes, disparaging team members or their work, or unconstructive criticism.

## How to report a problem:
There are a few options here. If you feel comfortable doing so, report the issue to one of the open leaders in email or in-person. We can work together to sort out the situation.
Another option is to fill out the reporting/feedback form online here. Provide details or, if it occurred online, a link to the incident.
Alternatively, send an email to one of the designated conflict resolution volunteers that have been chosen by the group.

## Consequences for Code-of-Conduct violations:
There are two warnings before someone is banned from the community until positive progress is demonstrated. The first warning will be an email from one of the leaders and, if advisable, a note of apology sent to the group by the member in question. The second will require both an apology and a plan for improvement in order to avoid further incidence.
Who decides what does and does not violate the code? What's an example of how this might be done?
The code of conduct is a continually updating document that takes input from any major contributors to the project. The leaders or the conflict resolution people will refer to it when something is reported to them to determine whether something violates code. If the person who was reported feels they’ve been judged unfairly, they can take the issue to the larger group for discussion.

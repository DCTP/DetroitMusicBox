    Restate your project vision

We’re working with The Detroit Digital Justice Coalition community and residents of Detroit neighborhoods to Facilitate the preservation of history through place-based storytelling so that People interested in preserving history in the face of gentrification can control the narratives of their own neighborhoods and spaces.

    Welcome contributors to the project: 

We look forward to telling you about the project and hopefully bringing you onto the team. The Detroit Music Box Application was originally put together by by Anderson and Diana at the Detroit Community Technology Project, along with folks at CoOpen, using the Podcastgen open source software. After a successful (and still ongoing) run in the Cass Corridor neighborhood of Detroit, Michigan, Kristyn Sonnenberg, another member of the Detroit Community Technology Project team, joined the Music Box work. We wanted to open the project up for use in other communities around the world. This work was moved forward as part of the Mozilla Open Leadership training series.

    Tell readers how to submit changes: This is the process for adding your work or changes to the repository or collection of ongoing work (Leave this blank for now-- we’ll cover how to manage contributions  on the web with an open workflow in the next module.) 


    Describe Good First bugs for Contributors:  Guidelines for the types of “bugs” or useful, helpful tasks new contributors should start with as they’re first coming on to a project. A bug often refers to a problem that needs to be fixed. These should be small, fairly easy but meaningful tasks that get a new contributor started and provide an early, encouraging success.  For a very new project, a good first bug might be to ask contributors to comment on your README file-- does it make sense, do they understand the project? Is all the information they need there? Are there any typos?

    Feedback on README file and Code of Conduct: point out anything that doesn’t make sense, anything particularly helpful, places where more elaboration is needed, typos, etc.

    Test out applications, submit bug report or suggestions

    Create help and how-to documentation on coding or on customizing and using the app.

    Look over this file - comment on what isn’t understandable, needs elaboration, etc.


    Tell readers how to report a bug: Ask your contributors to stay on the lookout for can any potential issue that might cause problems for the project. These could be problems in code (if you’re creating software), content omissions or copy errors (if you’re creating a learning resource), or any issues with the functionality or design of your project. Basically, by asking users to report bugs, you’re asking for feedback on work that’s been done. Most projects invite all contributors to tell the project lead about bugs, so "debugging" or fixing problems happens quickly and with the input of the community. Take a look at Atom's example for how to teach people to report bugs to your project. (Again, you may want to add to this section after you get comfortable with GitHub, and get everything online)


    Tell users about your recognition model - Remember, you need to acknowledge value of the time and work your volunteers give your project. Here, provide a pre-emptive "thank you" for interest contributing. List any recognition contributors might receive for participating in your project. You can also outline how contributors can “level up” to become project maintainers (a certain number of bugs resolved, a certain number of changes or contributions successfully submitted to the project). You can leave this blank for now, and fill it in later. 


    Let users know where to go for help - provide clear contact info, and outline the process for getting in touch, for anyone with questions.

# Detroit Music Box

Hello, and thank you for opening the Music Box README file! We look forward to telling you about the project and hopefully bringing you onto the team. The Detroit Music Box Application was originally put together by by Anderson and Diana at the Detroit Community Technology Project, along with folks at CoOpen, using the Podcastgen open source software. After a successful (and still ongoing) run in the Cass Corridor neighborhood of Detroit, Michigan, Kristyn Sonnenberg, another member of the Detroit Community Technology Project team, joined the Music Box work. We wanted to open the project up for use in other communities around the world. This work was moved forward as part of the Mozilla Open Leadership training series.

### Project Description

How can open source applications can support communities in organizing and preserving their own history through storytelling? This app offers a digital space for long time neighborhood residents who are experiencing gentrification to share and archive stories about place and space. The Detroit Music Box was created in partnership with the Detroit Digital Justice Coalition and residents of Detroit neighborhoods. Music Box is a simply constructed localized application that can be used for any neighborhood. We are working to facilitate the preservation of history through place-based storytelling, so that people interested in preserving history in the face of gentrification can control the narratives of their own neighborhoods and spaces.

The Music Box application centers the stories of long-term neighborhood residents. These stories can help educate gentrifying forces about existing communities and their narratives. This works against the “blank slate” assumptions gentrifiers often have about certain neighborhoods, seeing them as empty and struggling neighborhoods that are ripe for any kind of development. 

Music Box also provides a way for communities to facilitate community engagement, organizing storytelling events and mobile based storytelling abilities. Participants can share stories and interact with the spaces and histories around them, and new residents and developers can gain local context.
